      "synopsis": "Captain Flagg and Sergeant Quirt was based on the play What Price Glory? by Maxwell Anderson and Laurence Stallings. Flagg and Quirt, pugnacious leathernecks, were usually embroiled in a squabble over some 'dish,' also known as 'a real eyeful.' Writer Medbury researched Marine lingo at the San Diego Marine base, but the show's most memorable lines (Quirt's 'Sez who?' and Flagg's slower, denser, equally combative 'Sez me!') were already well known. It was the show's pugnacity that ran it aground. The Marines objected loudly to the notion of a captain 'being chewed out by a sergeant,' and the show was hastily reorganized. Quirt was dropped as a character, replaced by Sgt. Bliss. It didn't matter: the series folded six weeks later. - On The Air: The Encyclopedia of Old-Time Radio by John Dunning"
