      "info": "America in the Air was billed as 'a tribute to the daring men of the United States Air Forces'; its purpose was 'to give the average man on the ground a clear understanding of the Air Forces--its men, its equipment, and its operations.' The first broadcast told of the Flying Fortress Memphis Belle. The series used both drama and interviews. It may have been an important show in the Words at War genre, but no broadcasts have been unearthed at this writing, and all known data comes from a CBS publicity release.'; - Source: On the Air: The Encyclopedia of Old-Time Radio, John Dunning"
