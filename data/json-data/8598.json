      "info": "The start date is from the radio schedule of Jan. 16, 1933's issue of the Washington Post. - -------------------------- - According to the Washington Post article, On the Air Today written by Arthur Godfrey, of Jul 1, 1936, his first appearance on the Sun Dial was Jan. 15, 1934. - -------------------------- - In May, 1941, Arthur Godfrey started broadcasting on WABC in New York City. See the radio schedule of the New York Times for May 6, 1941. From the radio schedules of the Washington Post, it appears that this program was the first part of the Sun Dial Show broadcast on WJSV. However, see p.65 of Singer's book that seems to indicate that this was not the case. And this claim is supported by the July 7, 1941 issue of Time magazine. - -------------------------- - By Hickerson, the date of the final broadcast of this program is April 27, 1945 and Dunning confirms that the year was 1945. However, looking at the radio schedules of the Washington Post, it appears that the date is much later. For example, the March 29, 1946 issue of the Washington Post has Arthur Godfrey on at 7-9am EST. - However, from the New York Times, it appears that the final broadcast in New York City is April 27, 1945 which is probably the source for Hickerson's and Dunning's dates. However, Arthur Godfrey resumed broadcasting at an early hour in New York City (see the Nov. 2, 1946 issue of the New York Times and the Sept. 2, 1946 issue of Time magazine)."
